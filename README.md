# CAPSTONE

The capstone project at Portland State University was meant to get students involved in their community in different ways. I chose to focus my capstone on individual sustainability, and created a small series of lessons to teach students about the importance of renewable energy and individual ecological impact. The project was taught at an after school outdoors program over the course of five meetings and the kids really retained a good amount of the information. They also really enjoyed building the models on the last day.
